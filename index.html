        <p>Something excited happened.<br>
            truly it was exciting<br>
            A hot dog fell onto my head<br>
            and I was reuqured to buy the lottery<br>
            I didn't win anything, but was able to eat the hotdog that once fell on me.

            There once was a time in which there was a single broccoli in my plates, and it was a sad time. HOWEVER, that single brocooli had managed to win the war with itself and multiply. What a great feat it was

        <h2 id="o" class="title">the final day</h2>
        
        <p>Oh how I had thought the long days of old were gone, and with them, I leave. truly a statue such as I must eventually crumble to dust just as to how dust formed into rock and rock into me.  I just hope that noe day I am able to condense into rock once more and be formed into a great ccreation</p>
